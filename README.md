# VibesMasto-News-Monitor
A full-page news monitor with different sections for an RSS feed, trending Mastodon links and hashtags, and posts from any Mastodon hashtags you want to monitor.  Meant to cast to / display on a second screen.

I used to use Twitter to keep up with the news. I would check it sporadically during the day. I don't do that now because there's no telling what's going to end up in front of my eyes. 

So I made VibesMasto News Monitor (named after Vibesmaster G-Nice, who has a morning reggae program on Twitch ( https://www.twitch.tv/vibesmastergnice ) and to whom I'm listening right now) to keep me informed without making me having to check in on Twitter or CNN or anywhere else. I designed it as a full-page screen that I cast to a second montior that's on the end of my desk. Every morning I double-check the hashtags the program is monitoring, change them if necessary, and start the program. For the rest of the day I occasionally glance at it, and if anything looks interesting I can follow up by following a link.

I've tried to make it really easy for you to use. Download the index.html page. Open it in your browser and if you've enabled JavaScript it should just work. If you want to change the RSS news source (current the New York Times) or the Mastodon hashtags being monitored, I added lots of comments.
