# VibesMasto-News-Monitor
A full-page news monitor with different sections for an RSS feed, trending Mastodon links and hashtags, and posts from any Mastodon hashtags you want to monitor.  Meant to cast to / display on a second screen.

I used to use Twitter to keep up with the news. I would check it sporadically during the day. I don't do that now because there's no telling what's going to end up in front of my eyes. 

So I made VibesMasto News Monitor (named after Vibesmaster G-Nice, who has a morning reggae program on Twitch ( https://www.twitch.tv/vibesmastergnice ) and to whom I'm listening right now) to keep me informed without making me having to check in on Twitter or CNN or anywhere else. I designed it as a full-page screen that I cast to a second montior that's on the end of my desk. Every morning I double-check the hashtags the program is monitoring, change them if necessary, and start the program. For the rest of the day I occasionally glance at it, and if anything looks interesting I can follow up by following a link. 

I've just completely overhauled the code to make the settings easier to access and change. (There's also a Web-based version of VibesMasto at https://mastogizmos.com/vm.html if you don't want to download anything.) Download the index.html file, open it in your browser, and it should be self-explanatory. Use the gear settings icon on the lower right to change the settings.)
